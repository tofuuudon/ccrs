<p align="center">ccrs | conventional commits and semantic bumps</p>

<br>

Notice

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tool is one I've created for myself. I'm open to suggestions and improvements, so please do open an issue if you have anything to share. However, I'm quite a minimalist, so expect this project to follow suit.

<br>

Installation

```bash
brew tap tofuuudon/ccrs
brew install ccrs
```

<br>

Commit

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can specify which type of commit you'd like to create, e.g. `ft`, `fx`, and `rf` â€” which are `feat`, `fix`, and `refactor`, respectively. There are more types, please refer to the table below.

Bump

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must have an existing initial git tag for `ccrs bump` to work. It takes the existing semantic version, and bumps it by a major if it has a breaking change, a minor for `feat`, and a patch for `fix`. It will reuse any prefixes like `v` from the previous tag.
